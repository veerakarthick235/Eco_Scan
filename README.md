# EcoScan ‚ôªÔ∏è

**_Snap, Sort, Sustain._ Your AI-powered guide to responsible waste disposal.**

This project is a submission for the **Zero Boundaries Hackathon** in the **Social Good** track.

## ## Inspiration ‚ú®

Every day, countless recyclable and compostable items end up in landfills due to confusion about local disposal rules. Inspired by the hackathon's mission of "impact without borders" and the **Zero Dump Initiative**, we created **EcoScan**. Our goal is to break down the barriers of confusion and empower anyone, anywhere, to make environmentally responsible decisions with a simple photo.

## ## What It Does üéØ

EcoScan is a smart web application that uses real-time AI to identify waste items from an uploaded image. It instantly tells the user whether to **Recycle**, **Compost**, or put the item in the **Trash**, providing clear instructions and educational tips to encourage sustainable habits.

## ## Key Features üöÄ

* **üß† Real-Time AI Classification:** Utilizes a **TensorFlow** model (`MobileNetV2`) on a Python backend to recognize over 1,000 common objects from a user's photo.
* **üìç Location-Aware Suggestions:** Uses the browser's **Geolocation API** to fetch the user's coordinates, enabling future expansion for city-specific disposal rules.
* **üìà User Impact Tracking:** Leverages browser **localStorage** to keep a persistent history of scanned items, gamifying the experience by tracking the number of items recycled and composted.
* ** expandable Knowledge Base:** The AI's "vocabulary" can be easily expanded by mapping new object labels to disposal categories directly in the backend code.
